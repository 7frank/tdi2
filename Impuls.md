- back in 2019 i had the idea what if we could do react DI
  - i fiddled with https://astexplorer.net/ and found yes this could be a thing
  - although possible with babel at the time i did not follow this idea
- in 2021 i gave some talks about why react hooks are "cancer" and why they draw everything inward and are coupling tightly
  - and what to do about that, how to decouple react SOLID style
- later in feb 2023 i entertained the idea of autowiring like spring boot a rough poc came of that https://github.com/7frank/tdi
- now after yet again 2 years (june 2025) and briefly comming back to the react ecosysstem while mostly on svelte

  - after talking to a colleage and still hearing of the pains of the react ecosystem still feeling that react often used but selddom implemented in a decent manner in growing projects
    - i again gave DI and specially with react a try and https://github.com/7frank/tdi2 came out of it
