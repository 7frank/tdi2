## Enterprise-Grade Architecture for Scalable React Applications

**The Problem**: React components drowning in props, state synchronization hell, testing nightmares.

**The Solution**: Move ALL state and logic to services. Zero props. Pure templates. Automatic synchronization.

## TL;DR

```typescript
// ‚ùå Before: Props hell, manual state management
function UserDashboard({ userId, userRole, permissions, theme, loading, onUpdate, ... }) {
  // 15+ props, complex useEffect chains, manual synchronization
}

// ‚úÖ After: Zero props, automatic everything
function UserDashboard({ userService, appState }: {
  userService: Inject<UserServiceInterface>;
  appState: Inject<AppStateService>;
}) {
  return (
    <div className={`dashboard theme-${appState.state.theme}`}>
      <h1>{userService.state.currentUser?.name}</h1>
      <UserProfile />  {/* No props - gets data from services */}
    </div>
  );
}
```

**Result**: Components become templates. Services handle everything. Zero prop drilling. Automatic sync across your entire app.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Disclaimer

**üß™ Experimental Technology**: RSI is currently experimental and only works in client-side environments. Server-side rendering (SSR) support is not yet implemented.

**üìä Performance Claims**: All performance metrics and benchmarks referenced in this documentation are currently placeholders and educated guesses. Real-world performance data is still being collected.

**üìù Documentation Status**: Most documentation is in draft form and requires peer review. We're actively seeking feedback from the React community.

**ü§ù Contributing**: Found issues or have suggestions? Please [open an issue](https://github.com/your-repo/issues) or submit a pull request. Your feedback helps shape RSI's development.

## Primary Targets

### üè¢ Enterprise React Teams (10+ developers)

- Prop drilling with 15+ props per component
- Multiple teams stepping on each other's code
- Testing complexity from mocking dozens of props
- No architectural boundaries or consistency

### üéØ Dashboard/Admin Developers

- Complex state synchronization between components
- Performance issues from constant re-rendering
- Manual coordination between data views
- Zustand/Redux boilerplate for every feature

## Why RSI Changes Everything

| Traditional React           | RSI Approach             |
| --------------------------- | ------------------------ |
| 15+ props per component     | 0 data props             |
| Manual state sync           | Automatic everywhere     |
| Complex component testing   | Pure template testing    |
| No architectural boundaries | Clear service boundaries |
| Prop drilling hell          | Direct service injection |
