# Stateful Logic Reuse: The Composition Problem

## The Problem

In the class component era, sharing stateful logic between components was one of React's most painful limitations. Developers had two main options, both with significant drawbacks:

### Higher-Order Components (HOCs)
```javascript
function withToggle(Component) {
  return class extends React.Component {
    state = { isToggled: false };
    
    toggle = () => {
      this.setState(state => ({ isToggled: !state.isToggled }));
    };
    
    render() {
      return (
        <Component 
          {...this.props}
          isToggled={this.state.isToggled}
          toggle={this.toggle}
        />
      );
    }
  };
}

// Usage creates wrapper hell
const EnhancedComponent = withAuth(withToggle(withLoading(MyComponent)));
```

### Render Props
```javascript
class Toggle extends React.Component {
  state = { isToggled: false };
  
  toggle = () => {
    this.setState(state => ({ isToggled: !state.isToggled }));
  };
  
  render() {
    return this.props.children({
      isToggled: this.state.isToggled,
      toggle: this.toggle
    });
  }
}

// Usage creates deep nesting
function MyComponent() {
  return (
    <Toggle>
      {({ isToggled, toggle }) => (
        <Auth>
          {({ user, login }) => (
            <Loading>
              {({ loading, setLoading }) => (
                // Finally, actual component logic
                <div>...</div>
              )}
            </Loading>
          )}
        </Auth>
      )}
    </Toggle>
  );
}
```

### Core Issues
- **Wrapper Hell**: Deep nesting made components impossible to read and debug
- **Prop Namespace Pollution**: Multiple HOCs could conflict with prop names
- **Static Analysis Limitations**: Tools couldn't understand the component structure
- **Testing Complexity**: Required complex mocking and setup
- **Indirection**: Logic flow became obscured by abstraction layers

## The Solution: Custom Hooks

React hooks enabled clean, composable stateful logic:

```javascript
function useToggle(initialState = false) {
  const [isToggled, setIsToggled] = useState(initialState);
  
  const toggle = useCallback(() => {
    setIsToggled(state => !state);
  }, []);
  
  return { isToggled, toggle };
}

function useAuth() {
  const [user, setUser] = useState(null);
  const [loading, setLoading] = useState(false);
  
  const login = useCallback(async (credentials) => {
    setLoading(true);
    try {
      const user = await authService.login(credentials);
      setUser(user);
    } finally {
      setLoading(false);
    }
  }, []);
  
  return { user, login, loading };
}

// Clean usage
function MyComponent() {
  const { isToggled, toggle } = useToggle();
  const { user, login, loading } = useAuth();
  
  // Clear, readable component logic
  return <div>...</div>;
}
```

### Benefits
- **Flat Structure**: No more wrapper hell
- **Clear Dependencies**: Logic dependencies are explicit
- **Testability**: Hooks can be tested in isolation
- **Reusability**: Logic can be shared across any functional component
- **Composition**: Multiple hooks compose naturally

## 2025 Retrospective: Did It Work?

### ‚úÖ **Massive Success for Logic Sharing**

Custom hooks solved the immediate problems beautifully:
- **Developer Experience**: Logic sharing became intuitive
- **Code Reuse**: Common patterns (data fetching, form handling, etc.) became easily shareable
- **Testing**: Hook testing libraries made isolated testing straightforward
- **Ecosystem**: Rich ecosystem of custom hooks emerged

### ‚ö†Ô∏è **New Complexity Patterns Emerged**

However, new problems appeared as applications scaled:

**Hook Interdependencies**: Complex applications developed intricate hook dependency chains:
```javascript
function useComplexFeature() {
  const auth = useAuth();
  const permissions = usePermissions(auth.user);
  const config = useConfig(permissions.level);
  const data = useData(config.endpoints);
  const cache = useCache(data.cacheKey);
  
  // Each hook depends on previous ones
  // Debugging becomes complex
  // Performance optimization is difficult
}
```

**State Synchronization**: Multiple hooks managing related state:
```javascript
function MyComponent() {
  const { user } = useAuth();
  const { preferences } = useUserPreferences(user.id);
  const { theme } = useTheme(preferences.theme);
  const { layout } = useLayout(theme.mode);
  
  // Who owns what state?
  // How do they stay in sync?
  // What happens when one fails?
}
```

**Performance Optimization Challenges**: Hook composition made optimization difficult:
- Understanding re-render cascades
- Memoization dependencies across hooks
- Effect cleanup coordination
- Debugging performance bottlenecks

### üîÑ **The Architecture Gap**

While hooks solved logic sharing, they exposed larger architectural challenges:

**Service Management**: Applications need patterns for:
- Singleton services (auth, config, logging)
- Service lifecycle management
- Dependency injection between services
- Error handling and recovery

**State Architecture**: Teams struggle with:
- Where to put global state
- How to manage async state consistently
- Error boundaries and fallback strategies
- Testing complex state interactions

## 2025 Assessment: Is This Good?

### **For Component-Level Logic: Excellent**
Custom hooks remain the gold standard for sharing component-level stateful logic. The improvement over HOCs and render props is undeniable.

### **For Application Architecture: Insufficient**
Hooks were never designed to solve application-level architecture problems, and that's becoming apparent at scale.

### **The Missing Layer**
What's missing is the **service layer** that backend frameworks provide:

**Backend (Spring Boot)**:
```java
@Service
public class UserService {
    @Autowired
    private UserRepository userRepository;
    
    @Autowired
    private EmailService emailService;
    
    // Clear service boundaries
    // Automatic dependency injection
    // Testable in isolation
}
```

**Frontend (Current React)**:
```javascript
function useUserService() {
  const auth = useAuth();
  const email = useEmail();
  const repository = useUserRepository();
  
  // Manual dependency management
  // Unclear service boundaries
  // Complex testing setup
}
```

### **Where DI Frameworks Fit**
Your DI autowiring framework addresses exactly this gap:

**Traditional React**:
- Hooks handle component state
- Services are manually composed
- Dependencies are implicit
- Testing requires complex setup

**With DI Framework**:
- Hooks handle component state
- Services are automatically injected
- Dependencies are explicit
- Testing becomes straightforward

## Conclusion

Custom hooks solved the immediate logic sharing problem brilliantly, but they revealed that **composition at the component level doesn't automatically solve architecture at the application level**.

The hooks solution was absolutely worth it‚Äîit made React development significantly better. However, as applications scale, the need for additional architectural patterns becomes apparent. 

Your DI framework represents the next logical evolution: using the proven patterns from backend development to bring order to the frontend service layer, while preserving the component-level benefits that hooks provide.

The question isn't whether to use hooks (they're essential), but how to complement them with proper architectural patterns for large-scale applications.
