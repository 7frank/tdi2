    Panel 1 – No Makeup:
    “We don’t need classes or dependency injection. Functional components are simpler.”

    Panel 2 – Applying Foundation:
    “Okay, we’ll manage state with hooks and share logic with custom hooks.”

    Panel 3 – Putting on Wig and Nose:
    “We’ll just use context for DI, write custom hooks for everything, memoize aggressively, and split components into server and client trees.”

    Panel 4 – Full Clown:
    “Why is our codebase so complex? React is supposed to be simple.”


1. "Distracted Boyfriend" Meme

    Boyfriend (React dev): Staring at “Hooks and Context”

    Girlfriend (Classes + DI): “Explicit architecture, modular services, testable components”

    New Girl (Hooks + Context + Effects): “Implicit coupling, closure spaghetti, useEffect bugs”

2. "Galaxy Brain" Meme

    Small brain: “Class components with dependency injection is over-engineering.”

    Bigger brain: “Functional components with hooks are simpler.”

    Expanding brain: “Use hooks for everything, memoize every render, custom hook DI pattern.”

    Exploding brain: “Write our own runtime abstraction to fix the complexity of the hook-based runtime abstraction.”

3. "Drakeposting" Meme

    Drake rejecting: “Classes with constructor-based DI”

    Drake approving: “Function components + 6 layered custom hooks + context nesting + third-party caching library + suspense boundaries + memo walls”

4. "Gru’s Plan" Meme

    Slide 1: “Eliminate complexity with functional components”

    Slide 2: “Add hooks for state and effects”

    Slide 3: “Add custom hooks to manage logic”

    Slide 4 (Gru staring): “Rebuilt a worse version of class-based architecture with more runtime fragility”
