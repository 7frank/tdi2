## Critique: Core thesis

- [Memes](./Memes.md)

The Core Thesis: React's "solutions" are increasingly complex workarounds for architectural problems that proper DI would have prevented.
Key Observations:

- [Core Claims Analysis & Examples](./React%20Ecosystem%20Critique:%20Core%20Claims%20Analysis.md)

2013-2015: Problems were predictable (prop drilling, scattered logic)
2015-2016: Redux "solved" state management with massive boilerplate
2017-2018: Ecosystem fragmentation as teams reinvented architecture
2019: Hooks promised simplicity but created new complexity patterns
2020-2021: Performance crisis led to optimization hell
2022-2024: Modern React is incredibly complex despite the "simple" origins

- [Timeline](./React%20Evolution%20Timeline%20Simple%20to%20Complex.md)

- The Pattern: React → Creates Problem → Community Creates Complex Solution → New Problems → More Complex Solutions → Repeat

- The RSI Alternative: Clean service injection would have prevented most of these problems, keeping components simple throughout React's evolution.
  The Irony: React today is far more complex than a service-oriented architecture would have been in 2013. The community rejected "complex" enterprise patterns and ended up with something far more complex.
