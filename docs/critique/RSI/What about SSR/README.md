# RSI Server-Side Rendering: Overview & Feasibility

> **OUT OF SCOPE** we are currently focusing on client side react, if an easier way to implement SSR is being found in the near future or in case we nmade enough progress on client side adoption we might reconsider.

## Executive Summary

React Service Injection (RSI) presents both significant opportunities and unique challenges for server-side rendering. While RSI's dependency injection and service architecture could dramatically improve SSR scalability and maintainability, several technical hurdles must be addressed around hydration, service initialization, and state synchronization.

## Current RSI Architecture Recap

RSI eliminates props drilling through compile-time dependency injection:

```typescript
// Client-side RSI (current)
function UserProfile({ userService }: {
  userService: Inject<UserServiceInterface>
}) {
  const user = userService.state.currentUser
  return <div>{user?.name}</div>
}

// Transforms to:
function UserProfile() {
  const userService = useService('UserService') // Runtime injection
  const userSnap = useSnapshot(userService.state) // Valtio reactivity
  return <div>{userSnap.currentUser?.name}</div>
}
```

## SSR Adaptation Challenges

### 1. **Hydration Mismatch Prevention**

Server and client must have identical service state during hydration.

### 2. **Service Initialization Timing**

Services need different initialization strategies on server vs client.

### 3. **State Serialization**

Service state must be serializable for server-to-client transfer.

### 4. **Async Data Dependencies**

Server-side data fetching must complete before rendering.

## Potential Solutions Architecture

### Option A: Isomorphic Services

```typescript
@Service()
class UserService implements UserServiceInterface {
  state = { currentUser: null, loading: false };

  // Different implementations per environment
  async loadUser(id: string): Promise<void> {
    if (typeof window === "undefined") {
      // Server: Direct database access
      this.state.currentUser = await this.database.getUser(id);
    } else {
      // Client: API call
      this.state.currentUser = await this.api.getUser(id);
    }
  }
}
```

### Option B: Separate Server/Client Services

```typescript
// Server service
@Service("server")
class ServerUserService implements UserServiceInterface {
  async preloadUser(id: string): Promise<UserState> {
    return { currentUser: await this.database.getUser(id) };
  }
}

// Client service
@Service("client")
class ClientUserService implements UserServiceInterface {
  constructor(initialState: UserState) {
    this.state = initialState; // Hydrate from server
  }
}
```

## Benefits for Enterprise SSR

### ✅ **Architectural Consistency**

- Same service patterns across server and client
- Unified business logic regardless of rendering environment
- Clear separation between data access and presentation

### ✅ **Scalable Data Fetching**

- Services encapsulate data loading logic
- Easy to optimize and cache at service level
- Clear dependencies between services

### ✅ **Testing Advantages**

- Mock services for SSR testing
- Isolated business logic testing
- Consistent patterns across environments

## Major Technical Hurdles

### ❌ **Hydration Complexity**

Current Valtio proxies may not serialize/deserialize cleanly across server-client boundary.

### ❌ **Build Tool Integration**

TDI2 transformer needs separate configuration for server and client builds.

### ❌ **Performance Overhead**

DI container initialization and service instantiation on every server request.

### ❌ **React 19/Next.js Compatibility**

RSC pattern conflicts with current RSI approach of prop-based injection.

## Feasibility Assessment

### **Impact Potential: HIGH** 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥

- Could solve major enterprise SSR pain points
- Unified architecture across rendering environments
- Better separation of concerns than current SSR patterns

### **Implementation Complexity: HIGH** 🔴🔴🔴🔴

- Significant changes to RSI core architecture required
- Complex state synchronization challenges
- Integration challenges with modern React features

### **Scaling Benefits: VERY HIGH** 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀

- Enterprise teams could use same patterns everywhere
- Clear service boundaries aid large team development
- Easier testing and maintenance of SSR applications

## Recommendation

**Pursue SSR support for RSI** with phased approach:

1. **Phase 1**: Solve core hydration and state serialization
2. **Phase 2**: Optimize build tools for dual-environment compilation
3. **Phase 3**: Integrate with React Server Components pattern
4. **Phase 4**: Performance optimizations and caching strategies

The potential benefits for enterprise React development are substantial enough to justify the implementation effort.
