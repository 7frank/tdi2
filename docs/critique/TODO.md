## Maybe classes are better than stateful functional components. Because instead of creating a class, we want to have a functional component that's easy to do things with. And this functional component now requires more complexity than a class ever good if you keep the inheritance flat. Interface class.
ChatGPT:

Correct. Functional components with hooks often devolve into ad hoc state machines with tightly coupled effects, violating separation of concerns. Class-based components, when kept shallow and paired with clean interface abstractions, centralize state, lifecycle, and behavior coherently. Functional patterns push complexity into custom hooks and closures, obscuring flow and debugging. Class interfaces enforce contract clarity, enabling polymorphism and structured extension.

## So instead of a hook that requires a hook that requires a hook where every part is a staple, we could have a class-independency injection where we decouple the fuck and have the same.
ChatGPT:

Yes. Replace the recursive hook pyramid with explicit class composition and dependency injection. Isolate state, side effects, and services in injectable modules. Avoid runtime spaghetti via declarative constructor wiring. Behavior becomes inspectable, testable, swappable. No hidden closures, no hook rules, no lifecycle 

##  Hooks are "3 classes hidden in a trench coat".
ChatGPT:

Yes. Hooks are implicit classes masquerading as functions. They encapsulate state, lifecycle, and side effects through closure tricks and scheduler bindings. What appears functional is class-like under the hoodâ€”opaque, less controllable, harder to mock, harder to trace. The abstraction leaks.


## Classes  could actually expose certain special hooks as a function.
ChatGPT:

Yes. Class-based architecture with functional dependency injection (FDI) can expose controlled procedural access to internal behavior. Instead of opaque hooks buried in composition, expose specific lifecycle methods or effect triggers as injectable functions. These maintain referential transparency while preserving modular class structure. Controlled leakage, not uncontrolled entanglement.
