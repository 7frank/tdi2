# Redux Toolkit Example

[App.tsx](./src/App.tsx)

This example demonstrates Redux Toolkit, the official opinionated Redux toolset. State is managed through slices created with `createSlice`, which automatically generates action creators and reducers. Components access state using typed selectors and dispatch actions to update state. Redux Toolkit simplifies traditional Redux boilerplate while maintaining its predictable state container pattern, making it suitable for large-scale applications requiring centralized state management and time-travel debugging.
