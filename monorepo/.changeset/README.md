# Changesets

Hello and welcome! This folder has been automatically generated by `@changesets/cli`, a build tool that works
with multi-package repos, or single-package repos to help you version and publish your code. You can
find the full documentation for it [in our repository](https://github.com/changesets/changesets)

We have a quick list of common questions to get you started engaging with this project in
[our documentation](https://github.com/changesets/changesets/blob/main/docs/common-questions.md)

## Release packages

- Build packages
  bun run build

- Create changeset for your changes
  bun changeset

- Version packages (converts workspace:\* to real versions)
  bun changeset version

- Publish to npm
  bun changeset publish

**OR** with the new and fixed approach it should be

```
cd monorepo
bun run 1-changeset
bun run 2-version
bun run 3-release
```

if unsure before publishing you can check whats built after running step 2 in each package

```
bun pm pack
tar -xOf *.tgz package/package.json
```
