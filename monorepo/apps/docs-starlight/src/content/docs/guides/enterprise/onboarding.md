## 5-Day Learning Path

### Day 1: Architecture & Concepts (4 hours)

#### Morning Session (2 hours): Core Concepts
**üìö Required Reading:**
- [Quick Start Guide](../../getting-started/quick-start/) - Hands-on tutorial
- [Service Patterns](../../patterns/service-patterns/) - Essential patterns

**üéØ Learning Objectives:**
- Understand service-oriented architecture vs component-centric
- Grasp dependency injection and reactive state concepts
- Recognize benefits over traditional React patterns

**‚úÖ Knowledge Check:**
- Explain the difference between Controllers and Services
- Describe how dependency injection eliminates props drilling
- Identify when to use reactive state vs local component state

#### Afternoon Session (2 hours): Hands-On Setup
**üîß Practical Exercise:**
```bash
# 1. Set up development environment
git clone [team-repository]
cd [project-name]
bun install

# 2. Run existing application
bun run dev

# 3. Explore codebase structure
src/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ services/interfaces/     # Study existing service contracts
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ services/implementations/ # Review service implementations
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ components/              # See how components use services
```

**üéØ Exercise Goals:**
- Successfully run the application locally
- Navigate the service-oriented codebase structure
- Identify patterns in existing services and components

### Day 2: Service Development (6 hours)

#### Morning Session (3 hours): Build Your First Service

**üîß Guided Exercise: NotificationService**
```typescript
// 1. Define interface
interface NotificationServiceInterface {
  state: {
    notifications: Notification[];
    unreadCount: number;
  };
  showSuccess(message: string): void;
  showError(message: string): void;
  markAsRead(id: string): void;
  clearAll(): void;
}

// 2. Implement service
@Service()
export class NotificationService implements NotificationServiceInterface {
  state = {
    notifications: [] as Notification[],
    unreadCount: 0
  };

  showSuccess(message: string): void {
    const notification = {
      id: Date.now().toString(),
      type: 'success' as const,
      message,
      timestamp: new Date(),
      read: false
    };
    
    this.state.notifications.push(notification);
    this.state.unreadCount++;
  }

  // Complete implementation...
}
```

#### Afternoon Session (3 hours): Testing & Integration

**üß™ Write Service Tests:**
```typescript
describe('NotificationService', () => {
  let notificationService: NotificationService;

  beforeEach(() => {
    notificationService = new NotificationService();
  });

  it('should add success notification', () => {
    notificationService.showSuccess('Test message');
    
    expect(notificationService.state.notifications).toHaveLength(1);
    expect(notificationService.state.notifications[0].type).toBe('success');
    expect(notificationService.state.unreadCount).toBe(1);
  });
});
```

**üîó Create Component Integration:**
```typescript
function NotificationCenter({ notificationService }: {
  notificationService: Inject<NotificationServiceInterface>;
}) {
  const { notifications, unreadCount } = notificationService.state;
  
  return (
    <div className="notification-center">
      <div className="unread-count">{unreadCount}</div>
      {notifications.map(notification => (
        <NotificationItem 
          key={notification.id}
          notification={notification}
          onMarkRead={() => notificationService.markAsRead(notification.id)}
        />
      ))}
    </div>
  );
}
```

### Day 3: Real Feature Development (8 hours)
