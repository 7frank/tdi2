## Transform React Development

TDI2 (TypeScript Dependency Injection 2) revolutionizes React development by moving state and logic from components into reactive services, eliminating prop drilling and providing automatic state synchronization.

<CardGrid stagger>
	<Card title="üèóÔ∏è Service-Oriented Architecture" icon="setting">
		Move business logic into testable, reusable services. Components become pure templates.
	</Card>
	<Card title="‚ö° Automatic Reactivity" icon="rocket">
		Valtio-powered reactive state with surgical re-renders. No manual optimization needed.
	</Card>
	<Card title="üîß Compile-Time DI" icon="puzzle">
		Zero runtime overhead with build-time dependency injection and interface resolution.
	</Card>
	<Card title="üß™ Testing Excellence" icon="approve-check">
		Simple service unit testing and easy component mocking. Test business logic in isolation.
	</Card>
</CardGrid>

## Quick Example

Transform your React components from props hell to clean service injection:

```typescript
// ‚ùå Before: Props drilling and manual state management
function ProductList({ 
  products, 
  loading, 
  onAddToCart, 
  cartItems, 
  user, 
  theme,
  /* ...15+ more props */ 
}) {
  // Complex useEffect chains, manual synchronization
}

// ‚úÖ After: Clean service injection
function ProductList({ 
  productService,
  cartService 
}: {
  productService: Inject<ProductServiceInterface>;
  cartService: Inject<CartServiceInterface>;
}) {
  const { products, loading } = productService.state;
  
  return (
    <div>
      {products.map(product => (
        <ProductCard 
          key={product.id}
          productId={product.id}
          onAddToCart={() => cartService.addToCart(product)}
        />
      ))}
    </div>
  );
}
```
