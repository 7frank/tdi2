# Feedback Summary on React Autowiring Dependency Injection Framework (Enterprise Context)

---

## 1. **Service Bloat**  
**Criticism:** Components require injection of 5â€“8 services, indicating possible architectural miscuts.  
**Response:** Hypothetical symptom, not a consequence of the pattern itself. Excessive service injection signals deeper architectural issues, not a fault of DI.

---

## 2. **Lack of Hooks Usage**  
**Criticism:** Avoiding React hooks contradicts idiomatic React and complicates embedding component-specific logic.  
**Response:** Hooks address symptoms, not root problems. They introduce their own complexity. DI is an alternative path, not a rejection. It coexists with hooks where appropriate.

---

## 3. **Singleton-Only Services**  
**Criticism:** No support for subtree or component-scoped instances.  
**Response:** Singleton is an initial implementation. Scoped and per-component lifecycles are on the roadmap.

---

## 4. **Unclean Valtio Integration**  
**Criticism:** Inconsistent use of snapshot vs. state creates risk of side-effect-prone access.  
**Response:** Integration is experimental. Focus is on conceptual clarity. Other state layers like MobX are being explored.

---

## 5. **Compile-Time Magic**  
**Criticism:** Reduces debuggability and maintainability; increases onboarding difficulty.  
**Response:** Tooling in development: CLI and visual dependency mapping will improve traceability and onboarding.

---

## 6. **Spaghetti Code in MVP**  
**Criticism:** Prototype lacks architectural clarity, undermining trust in quality.  
**Response:** MVP status implies instability. Working example + packaged release defines the v0.0.1 threshold.

---

## 7. **Existing Alternatives**  
**Criticism:** Similar tools already exist (e.g., tsyringe, tsinject, LemonDI).  
**Response:** Most lack autowiring, strong type/interface integration, or maturity. This pattern covers that gap.

## 8. **Unclear Target Audience**  
**Criticism:** Benefits unclear for mainstream React use; niche focus not well-communicated.  
**Response:** Intentionally non-mainstream. Target is large-scale, modular enterprise applications where React patter
