## CLIENT FOCUS: Immediate Architectural Shifts

### 1. Hidden Dependencies 🟡 **Partially Solved** 🎯 CLIENT FOCUS

**Problem**: Data/control flow ceases to be fully explicit via props. Inversion of control moves construction and wiring out of component trees into containers. Debugging requires DI graph introspection.

**Current State**: 
- ✅ Interface-based resolution provides clear dependency contracts
- ✅ Compile-time validation catches missing implementations
- ❌ Runtime dependency graph introspection is limited

**Solutions**:
- **Easy (Immediate)**: Add debug mode to container with dependency graph visualization
- **Medium (Next Phase)**: React DevTools integration showing DI service tree
- **Future**: Hot-reload aware dependency tracking

```typescript
// Current debugging capability
container.debugContainer(); // Shows registered services

// Proposed enhancement
container.getDependencyGraph(); // Returns full dependency tree
```

**Difficulty**: Easy to Medium

---

### 2. Render-Purity Pressure 🟢 **Solved** 🎯 CLIENT FOCUS

**Problem**: React rendering must be pure. Any DI lookup must be pure, referentially stable, and side-effect-free. Service creation cannot occur during render without memoization.

**Current State**:
- ✅ Services are pre-registered at container level
- ✅ Resolution happens outside render cycle
- ✅ Functional DI transformer ensures stable references

**Solution Implemented**:
```typescript
// Services resolved at container boundary, not during render
const userService = container.resolve<UserServiceInterface>("UserServiceInterface");

// Functional components get stable service references
function UserProfile({ userService }: { userService: Inject<UserServiceInterface> }) {
  // userService is stable across re-renders
}
```

**Difficulty**: Solved

---

### 3. State Ownership Conflict 🟡 **Partially Solved** 🎯 CLIENT FOCUS

**Problem**: Hooks localize state to components; services centralize it. Two parallel state models emerge. Teams must decide whether long-lived state lives in services or hooks.

**Current State**:
- ✅ Services use Valtio for reactive state management
- ✅ Clear separation: services for business logic, hooks for UI state
- ❌ No formal guidelines for state ownership decisions

**Solutions**:
- **Easy**: Document state ownership patterns and best practices
- **Medium**: Create linting rules to enforce patterns
- **Future**: Hybrid state bridges between services and hooks

**Recommended Pattern**:
```typescript
// ✅ Service state: Business logic, cross-component concerns
@Service()
class UserService {
  state = { user: null, isLoading: false }; // Valtio reactive state
}

// ✅ Hook state: UI-specific, component-local concerns  
function UserForm() {
  const [formData, setFormData] = useState({}); // UI form state
  const userService = useService(UserServiceToken); // Business state
}
```

**Difficulty**: Easy to Medium

---

### 4. Scheduling Interaction 🟢 **Solved** 🎯 CLIENT FOCUS

**Problem**: React can pause, resume, and replay renders. Injected services must not assume commit has happened. Initialization that touches I/O or global state must be deferred.

**Current State**:
- ✅ Services are created at container level, not during render
- ✅ No side effects during service resolution
- ✅ Valtio handles state updates safely

**Solution Implemented**:
```typescript
@Service()
class ApiService {
  constructor() {
    // ✅ Safe: No I/O in constructor
    this.state = { data: null };
  }
  
  // ✅ I/O happens in methods, called from effects
  async loadData() {
    this.state.data = await fetch('/api/data');
  }
}
```

**Difficulty**: Solved

---

### 5. Tree-Shaking and Bundle Layout 🟡 **Partially Solved** 🎯 CLIENT FOCUS

**Problem**: Reflection-style DI erodes dead-code elimination. Token-based, compile-time DI preserves tree-shaking but constrains patterns.

**Current State**:
- ✅ Compile-time interface resolution preserves tree-shaking
- ✅ No runtime reflection or string-based lookups
- ❌ Code-splitting with DI not fully addressed

**Solutions**:
- **Easy**: Document tree-shaking best practices
- **Medium**: Implement chunk-aware service registration
- **Future**: Automatic code-splitting based on service boundaries

```typescript
// ✅ Tree-shakable: Compile-time interface resolution
const service = container.resolve<UserService>("UserServiceInterface");

// ❌ Not tree-shakable: Runtime reflection
const service = container.resolve(getServiceToken("UserService"));
```

**Difficulty**: Medium

---

### 6. Testing Model Change 🟡 **Partially Solved** 🎯 CLIENT FOCUS

**Problem**: Unit tests shift from "render with props" to "render with container". Overriding providers replaces context mocks.

**Current State**:
- ✅ `@DiTest` and `@MockBean` decorators exist
- ✅ Container-based testing patterns established
- ❌ Migration guides for existing test suites incomplete

**Solutions**:
- **Easy**: Complete testing documentation with migration examples
- **Medium**: Create test utilities for common patterns
- **Future**: Automatic test migration tools

```typescript
// Current testing approach
@DiTest({
  providers: [
    { provide: UserServiceInterface, useClass: MockUserService }
  ]
})
class UserComponentTest {
  @MockBean
  userService: UserServiceInterface;
}
```

**Difficulty**: Easy to Medium

---

## CLIENT FOCUS: Scoping Model Requirements

### 7. App Scope 🟢 **Solved** 🎯 CLIENT FOCUS

**Problem**: One instance for the whole runtime. Dangerous in SSR—risk of cross-request leakage.

**Current State**:
- ✅ Singleton scope implemented and working
- ✅ Clear separation from request-scoped services

**Solution**: Current singleton implementation is sufficient for app-level services.

**Difficulty**: Solved

---

### 8. Request/Render Scope (SSR/RSC) 🔴 **Not Solved** 🖥️ SERVER FUTURE

**Problem**: Per HTTP request or per render pass. Mandatory to keep isolation on the server.

**Current State**:
- ❌ No request-scoped containers
- ❌ SSR isolation not implemented

**Solutions**:
- **Medium**: Implement request-scoped containers
- **Hard**: Full SSR/RSC integration with React.cache

```typescript
// Proposed request scope
@Service()
@Scope("request")
class RequestContextService {
  constructor(private requestId: string) {}
}

// SSR-safe container per request
const requestContainer = createRequestScopedContainer(request);
```

**Difficulty**: Medium to Hard
**Priority**: High for SSR applications

---

### 9. Tree Scope 🔴 **Not Solved** 🎯 CLIENT FOCUS

**Problem**: Per provider subtree (similar to Context boundary). Enables multi-tenant or A/B variants.

**Current State**:
- ❌ No tree-scoped providers
- ❌ No React tree integration for scoping

**Solutions**:
- **Medium**: Create `<ServiceProvider>` component for tree scoping
- **Hard**: Full React Suspense and Error Boundary integration

```typescript
// Proposed tree scope
<ServiceProvider overrides={[
  { provide: PaymentService, useClass: StripePaymentService }
]}>
  <CheckoutFlow />
</ServiceProvider>
```

**Difficulty**: Medium to Hard
**Priority**: Medium for multi-tenant apps

---

### 10. Component Scope 🟡 **Partially Solved** 🎯 CLIENT FOCUS

**Problem**: New instance per mount. Maps to useRef/constructor-like lifetime.

**Current State**:
- ✅ Transient scope provides new instances
- ❌ No component-lifetime binding

**Solutions**:
- **Easy**: Document transient scope for component-scoped services
- **Medium**: Create `useComponentScopedService` hook

**Difficulty**: Easy to Medium

---

### 11. Effect/Event Scope 🔴 **Not Solved** 🎯 CLIENT FOCUS

**Problem**: Ephemeral helpers created per effect or per user interaction.

**Solutions**:
- **Medium**: Create factory services for ephemeral instances
- **Future**: Event-driven service lifecycle

**Difficulty**: Medium
**Priority**: Low

---

## SERVER FUTURE: React Server Components / SSR Implications

### 12. Server Isolation 🔴 **Not Solved** 🖥️ SERVER FUTURE

- **Easy**: Implement `useService` hook
- **Medium**: Integration with React DevTools

```typescript
// Proposed hook API
function UserProfile() {
  const userService = useService(UserServiceToken);
  return <div>{userService.state.user.name}</div>;
}
```

**Difficulty**: Easy

---
