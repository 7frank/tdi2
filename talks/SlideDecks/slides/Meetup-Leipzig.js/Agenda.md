# "Beyond Hooks Hell: How Service Injection Fixes React's Broken Architecture"

## Talk Agenda (45-60 minutes)

### Opening Hook (5 minutes) üéØ
**"Hooks hell survivors - raise your hands!"**
- Show React's official useEffect fetch example from docs
- **The Promise**: "I'll show you the same functionality with zero hooks, zero props, and automatic synchronization"

---

### Act I: React's Scaling Crisis (10 minutes) üìàüí•

#### The Evidence (5 minutes)
- **Props Hell**: Component trees drowning in data
- **Testing Nightmare**: Mocking 10+ props for every test  
- **Hooks Complexity**: Coupling, dependency arrays, cleanup, race conditions
- **No Architecture**: Every team invents their own patterns

#### The Root Cause (5 minutes)
- **Mixed Concerns**: UI + Business Logic + State Management
- **No Boundaries**: Functional Components / hooks as God Objects (contain everything from view, business logic, "just put it in a hook")
- **Architecture Debt**: Each "solution" creates new problems

---

### Act II: Side-by-Side Comparison (20 minutes) üíª‚ú®

#### Example 1: Basic Data Fetching (10 minutes)
**Traditional React (from official docs):**
- Show useEffect fetch pattern
- Props drilling through components
- Manual error/loading state management
- Testing complexity

**Service Injection Alternative:**
- Clean service with business logic
- Zero props between components
- Automatic state synchronization
- Simple testing through service mocks

#### Example 2: Enterprise Forms (10 minutes)
**Traditional React:**
- Complex form state management
- Props threading through form sections
- Manual validation coordination
- Component coupling

**Service Injection:**
- Form services with clear responsibilities
- Repository pattern for data access
- Service interfaces defining contracts
- Architectural layers that make sense

---

### Act III: The Technology Deep Dive (15 minutes) üîß

#### How RSI Works (8 minutes)
- **Compile-Time Magic**: TDI2 transformation
- **Spring Boot for React**: Familiar patterns for backend developers
- **TypeScript-First**: Interface-driven development
- **Architectural Layers**: Services, Repositories, Interfaces

#### The Stack (7 minutes)
- **TDI2**: Dependency injection container, interface-based, autowiring
- **Valtio**: "Current solution" for reactive state management  
- **TypeScript**: Compile-time safety
- **Services**: Where your business logic lives

---

### Act IV: Why This Matters (10 minutes) üèóÔ∏è

#### Enterprise Benefits (5 minutes)
- **Team Scalability**: Clear service boundaries
- **Testing Revolution**: Mock services, not components
- **SOLID Compliance**: Finally possible in React
- **Familiar Patterns**: Backend developers feel at home

#### Industry Context (5 minutes)
- **Learning from Angular**: What React missed
- **Backend Wisdom**: Applying proven architectural patterns
- **The Future**: Service-centric development

---

### Closing: The Call to Action (5 minutes) üöÄ

#### Community & Resources
- **GitHub Repository**: Examples and documentation
- **Open Source**: Contribute with PRs, open issues for questions
- **Migration Guide**: Start experimenting today

#### The Vision (maybe)
- **React's Evolution**: From view library to application framework
- **Developer Experience**: From chaos to clarity
- **Enterprise Ready**: React that actually scales

## Interactive Elements üé≠

### Audience Participation
1. **Opening Poll**: "Who likes hooks? Hooks hell survivors - raise your hands!"
   - Follow-up: "How many useEffects in a functional component / hook did you have at worst? 1? 2? 3? 4??? 5?"
2. **Technology Survey**: "Who knows Spring Boot?"
3. **Pain Point Check**: "Who's tired of React / hooks not providing any structure besides hooks?"
   - Follow-up: "Who thinks React is still simpler than say Svelte / Angular?"
   - Follow-up: "Who thinks React has too many implicit quirks to follow / Rules of Hooks?"
4. **Closing Question**: "Who's willing to try this in their next project?"

### Code Comparisons
- **Before/After Examples**: Side-by-side traditional vs service injection
- **Testing Examples**: Compare mock complexity
- **Architecture Diagrams**: Visual representation of service layers

## Key Messages üéØ

### Opening Hook
*"I'm going to show you how to eliminate useEffect and props from React components entirely."*

### Core Problem
*"React's current patterns don't scale - we need architectural boundaries."*

### Solution Preview
*"Service injection gives us Angular's enterprise patterns with React's simplicity."*

### Call to Action
*"React is evolving from a view library to an application framework. Join the transformation."*
